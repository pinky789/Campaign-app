Starting the project
1.	We created the project using create-react-app

npm create-react-app react-app

cd react-app

2.	Installed JSON server to fetch data

npm install -g json-server

3.	Then run “json-server” and “react-app” by running the command below

json-server –watch db.json –port 3001

npm run start

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.	

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
